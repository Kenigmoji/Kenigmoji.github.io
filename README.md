Kenigmoji
========

Version 2 of the KineMaster set is no longer supported by KineMaster (nor Ranks.com). 
Version 3 has a slightly different design and new, more restrictive licensing terms. 
Access to high-resolution bitmap sources is now restricted to paying customers.
Some people prefer the flat cartoon design and the FOSS license with actual access to the PNG sources.
Therefore, we created a fork of Kinemaster version 2.2.7 as Kenigmoji with initial version 2.3. 
The artwork of this second generation of the web's first complete open source emoji set is and will stay 100% free.

Differences from KineMaster
-----------------------------

Kenigmoji is restricted to the artwork, i.e. image files.
SVG is its native format. Everything else is derived from that.

As of its initial release in August 2024, Kenigmoji did not contain any additional artwork.
